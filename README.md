# üìö Student Management System ‚Äì J2EE & PostgreSQL

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview

The **Student Management System** is a web-based application built using **Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE)**. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing student information within a system that supports **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations. This project uses **PostgreSQL** as the database management system to securely store and retrieve user and student data.

## ‚ú® Features

### 1. **User Authentication**
- Users (students) need to create an account to access the system.
- User credentials are stored in the PostgreSQL database.
- The system verifies the user‚Äôs credentials during login.
- Passwords are securely stored using hashing (optional: **mention if you used encryption**).

### 2. **Student Management (CRUD Operations)**
Once logged in, a user can perform the following operations on student data:
- **Create:** Add new student information, including:
  - Name
  - Roll Number
  - Date of Birth
  - Course Details
  - Contact Information
  - Address
- **Read:** View detailed student information in a well-structured format.
- **Update:** Edit and update existing student information.
- **Delete:** Remove student information from the system.

### 3. **User-Friendly Interface**
- A simple and intuitive user interface designed with JSP (JavaServer Pages).
- Forms and input validation for smooth user experience.
- Error messages and success notifications.

| **J2EE**        | Java-based platform for building web applications.                          |
| **PostgreSQL**  | Relational database management system to store and manage user/student data.|
| **JSP**         | JavaServer Pages for building dynamic web pages.                            |
| **Servlets**    | Handle server-side logic and communication with the database.               |

| **Apache Tomcat** | Servlet container to deploy and run the application.                     |

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Structure

The application uses a PostgreSQL database with the following structure:

### **Table: `users`** (Stores user account details)
| Column Name | Data Type | Description             |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| `id`        | INT       | Primary Key (auto-increment). |
| `username`  | VARCHAR   | Unique username for login.  |
| `password`  | VARCHAR   | Hashed password for authentication. |
| `email`     | VARCHAR   | User's email address.      |

### **Table: `students`** (Stores student details)
| Column Name   | Data Type | Description             |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| `id`          | INT       | Primary Key (auto-increment). |
| `name`        | VARCHAR   | Full name of the student. |
| `roll_number` | VARCHAR   | Unique roll number for each student. |
| `dob`         | DATE      | Date of birth of the student. |
| `course`      | VARCHAR   | Course enrolled by the student. |
| `contact`     | VARCHAR   | Contact number.          |
| `address`     | TEXT      | Residential address.     |

## üîÑ Application Flow

1. **User Registration:**  
   The user registers by providing a unique username, password, and email.
2. **Login:**  
   The user logs in with their credentials, which are verified against the data in the PostgreSQL database.
3. **Dashboard:**  
   After successful login, the user is redirected to a dashboard where they can manage student records.
4. **Perform CRUD Operations:**  
   The user can create, read, update, and delete student information.
5. **Logout:**  
   The user can log out of the system, which terminates the session.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-management-system.git
cd student-management-system
```

### 2. **Set Up the Database**
- Install PostgreSQL on your system.
- Create a database named `student_management`.
- Run the following SQL script to create necessary tables:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE students (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    roll_number VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    dob DATE NOT NULL,
    course VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    contact VARCHAR(15),
    address TEXT
);
```

### 3. **Configure Database Connection**
Update the database configuration in the `db.properties` file (or wherever you define your database connection):
```properties
db.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/student_management
db.username=your_postgresql_username
db.password=your_postgresql_password
```

### 4. **Run the Application**
- Deploy the project to **Apache Tomcat** or your preferred servlet container.
- Access the application at `http://localhost:8080/student-management`.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features
- Password hashing using **SHA-256** (or any other hashing algorithm) for secure storage of user credentials.
- Input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- Session management to ensure secure login and logout processes.

## üìù Future Enhancements
- Implement **role-based access control** for administrators and students.
- Add **search and filter** functionality for student records.
- Implement **RESTful APIs** for external integrations.
- Add **email notifications** for important updates.
